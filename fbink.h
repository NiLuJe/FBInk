// NOTE: There's a dirty bit of trickery involved here to coerce enums into a specific data type (instead of an int):
//       * The packed attribute, which does locally what GCC's -fshort-enums does globally,
//         ensuring the enum's data type is only as wide as the actual values require.
//       * A tail element with a value corresponding to the MAX of the target data type,
//         mainly used to enforce an unsigned data type.
//       BUT, while this "works" in C, this is essentially non-standard, and would break most automatic bindings,
//       which happily assume we're not breaking the C standard, and as such expect an enum to be int-sized...
//       So, in addition to that, instead of using the enum's typedef directly, we go through an explicit typedef.
//       This obviously still works in C because enums are dumb, they're basically unscoped constants,
//       and this makes bindings happy because they'll have an explicit typedef to rely on.
//       Fun fact: this is essentially what the Go bindings were already doing ;).

//       which means the EPDC itself will attempt to bundle updates together in order to do the least amount of work possible.
//       (By work, I mean moving the eInk capsules around, i.e., limiting to amount of effective refreshes).
//       A fun example of this can be seen with the dump/restore tests in utils/dump.c:
//       By default, it will call fbink_wait_for_complete at sensible times, but if you pass a random argument to it,
//       it won't: the difference that makes in practcie should be extremely obvious, especially for the first set of tests!
// NOTE: I encourage you to strace your stock reader to see how it makes use of those ioctls:
//       they're mostly used before and/or after FULL (i.e., flashing) updates,
//       to make sure they don't get affected by surrounding updates.
//       They can also be used to more predictably fence A2 updates.
//       In fact, for the most part, you can think of them as a kind of vsync fence.
//       Be aware that the ioctl will block for (relatively) longer than it takes for the refresh to visually end,
//       and that the delay depends for the most part on the waveform mode (flashing & region size have a much smaller impact).
//       With some waveform modes (mainly A2/DU), it'll return significantly earlier if the region's fb content hasn't changed.
// NOTE: See KOReader's mxc_update @ https://github.com/koreader/koreader-base/blob/master/ffi/framebuffer_mxcfb.lua
//       for some fancier examples in a complex application, where one might want to wait for completion of previous updates
//       right before sending a flashing one, for example.
// NOTE: Prior to FBInk 1.20.0, we used to *enforce* a wait_for_complete *after* *every* flashing (FULL) update.
//       This was originally done to mimic eips's behavior when displaying an image.
//       While blocking right after a refresh made sense for a one-off CLI tool, it's different for API users:
//       in most cases, it probably makes more sense to only block *before* the *following* flashing refresh,
//       thus ensuring that the wait will be shorter (or near zero), since time has probably passed between those two refreshes.
//       But, if you know that you won't be busy for a while after a flashing update, it might make sense to wait right after it,
//       in order to avoid an ioctl on the next refresh that might end up hurting reactivity...
//       Incidentally, as all of this depends on specific use-cases, this is why it is entirely left to the user,
//       and why there's no compatibility flag in FBInkConfig to restore the FBInk < 1.20 behavior ;).
